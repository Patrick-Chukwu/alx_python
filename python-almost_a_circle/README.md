# Wrap up of several concepts in Python
This is geared towards getting a better understanding of Python by using those concepts to build an actual project

## Unit test
Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation. The goal of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of code (such as functions, methods, or classes) works as expected and produces the correct output for various inputs. By testing units in isolation, you can catch bugs and issues early in the development process, making it easier to identify and fix problems before they propagate to higher levels of the application.

Here's how to implement unit testing in a large project:

Choose a Unit Testing Framework:

Select a unit testing framework suitable for your programming language. Popular frameworks for Python include unittest, pytest, and nose.
Organize Test Files:

Create a separate directory for your test files. It's common to have a directory structure mirroring your project's source code structure, where each module or package has a corresponding test module.
Write Test Cases:

Create test cases by defining test functions or methods within test modules.
Test cases should cover various scenarios, including edge cases and typical use cases. Each test should focus on a specific aspect of the unit you're testing.
Use Assertions:

Inside your test functions, use assertions to validate that the actual output matches the expected output.
Assertions are typically functions like assertEqual(), assertRaises(), etc., provided by the testing framework.
Isolate Dependencies:

Use techniques like mocking or stubbing to isolate the unit being tested from its dependencies. This ensures that the tests focus solely on the unit itself.
Run Tests:

Use the testing framework's test runner to discover and run your test cases.
The framework will execute each test case and report whether they pass or fail.
Automate Testing:

Set up automated testing using continuous integration (CI) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
Automated testing ensures that tests are run whenever changes are pushed to the codebase, catching regressions early.
Code Coverage:

Use code coverage tools to assess which parts of your code are covered by your tests.
Aim for high code coverage to ensure that your tests exercise as much of the code as possible.
Test Maintenance:

Regularly update and maintain your test suite as your code evolves.
Add new tests for new features, and update existing tests for changes.
Integration with Build Process:

Integrate unit tests into your build process. For instance, you can configure your build script to run tests before deploying or releasing code.
Refactor and Improve:

As you gain experience with unit testing, you can refactor your tests for better organization, readability, and efficiency.
Unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of large projects. By following these steps and incorporating unit testing practices into your development workflow, you can catch errors early, reduce the likelihood of regressions, and make your project more robust overall.

`import unittest

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.calculator = Calculator()

    def test_add(self):
        result = self.calculator.add(3, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, 8)

    def test_multiply(self):
        result = self.calculator.multiply(3, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, 15)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
